### Project Description
ConnectGo is a web app connecting travelers with shared interests to split accommodations and expenses seamlessly. Users match by destination, dates, and preferences, chat securely, and plan trips together for cost savings and safer adventures.

### The Problem statement
Travelers often face high accommodation and travel costs, lack of companionship, and safety concerns when exploring new destinations. Finding compatible travel partners with matching itineraries, budgets, and interests remains challenging without reliable platforms. This results in expensive solo trips, missed opportunities for shared experiences, and reduced travel frequency.

### The Solution
ConnectGo resolves these issues through an intuitive mobile app that matches solo travelers based on destination, travel dates, budget, interests, and preferences using smart algorithms. Users connect via verified profiles and secure in-app chat to co-book accommodations and split expenses effortlessly. Additional safety features like real-time itinerary sharing, emergency contacts, and user ratings ensure trustworthy partnerships, enabling affordable, enjoyable, and secure group travel.
